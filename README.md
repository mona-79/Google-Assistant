# Google Assistance

## Project Overview

"Google Assistance" is a Python-based interactive assistant that leverages Google Gemini's generative AI to answer user queries. The system interacts with users by classifying questions and responding with either pre-defined responses or dynamic content generated by Google Gemini. Additionally, it converts the generated text into speech using `gTTS` and plays it back to the user.

## Features

- **Interactive Question Handling**: The system prompts the user for input, classifies questions into categories such as device-related, personal, or web search queries, and provides appropriate responses.
- **Google Gemini Integration**: For queries requiring dynamic responses, the system uses Google Gemini to generate answers.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts generated answers into speech and plays it back using the `gTTS` library.
- **Markdown Formatting**: Enhances the display experience by converting the generated text into Markdown format.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install gtts google-generativeai
     ```

2. **Configure API Key**:
   - Retrieve your Google API key and set it up in your environment.

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Execute the script:
     ```bash
     python google_assistance.py
     ```
   - The assistant will start by asking for your name and then proceed to handle your queries interactively.

## Code Structure

- **ask_question(name)**: Prompts the user for a query and returns it.
- **classify_questions(ques)**: Classifies the question into categories and decides whether to proceed with a Google Gemini web search.
- **ask_gemini(ques)**: Uses Google Gemini to generate content based on the query.
- **speak(answer)**: Converts the generated text to speech and plays it back to the user.
- **Main Loop**: Handles the user interaction, processing each query in sequence.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `gTTS` for text-to-speech functionality
- `google-generativeai` for Google Gemini API integration

## Customization

- **Expand Classification**: Add more categories and responses for different types of questions.
- **Enhance Interaction**: Implement more sophisticated input validation and error handling.
- **Persistent Settings**: Allow users to save preferences or session history.
